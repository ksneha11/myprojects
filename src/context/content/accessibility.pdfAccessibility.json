We make sure screen readers, like JAWS or NVDA, can relay words. This includes “tagging” pictures with words and using headings and lists. We also set the language and title properties. This helps electronic reading tools know what language to use and how to speak the words on the page. Some of our older PDFs may not have these features. If there’s a PDF you can’t read, please use the contact information below to let us know. We can send it to you in another format.",
